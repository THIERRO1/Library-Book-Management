# Library-Book-Management
This PL/SQL project manages library books using Collections, Records, and GOTO. It stores book details, checks for invalid data, and uses GOTO for error handling. The program displays valid records using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE, showing how PL/SQL handles data processing and control flow effectively.
